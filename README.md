## Tech Stack

### Backend

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Language | Java 17+ |
| Framework | Spring Boot 3.2.5, Spring Cloud |
| Database | MySQL 8.x |
| Messaging | Apache Kafka |
| API Gateway | Spring Cloud Gateway |
| Service Discovery | Netflix Eureka |
| Inter-Service Communication | OpenFeign |
| Security | JWT Authentication |
| Documentation | Swagger / OpenAPI 3 |
| Containerization | Docker & Docker Compose |

### Frontend

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build Tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| State Management | TanStack Query (React Query) |
| Routing | React Router v7 |
| HTTP Client | Axios |

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following patterns:

- **Service Discovery**: All services register with Eureka for dynamic discovery
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point handling routing, authentication, and load balancing
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka enables asynchronous communication between Payment and Notification services
- **Feign Clients**: Declarative REST clients for synchronous inter-service communication
- **Modern Frontend**: React SPA with TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching

### Request Flow

1. User interacts with the **React Frontend** (port 3000)
2. Frontend sends API requests to **Gateway Service** (port 8090)
3. Gateway validates JWT token via `JwtAuthFilter`
4. Gateway discovers target service via **Eureka**
5. Request is routed to the appropriate microservice
6. Services communicate internally using **Feign clients**
7. Async events (e.g., payment completed) are published to **Kafka**

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** (v20.10+)
- **Docker Compose** (v2.0+)
- **Java 17+** (for backend development)
- **Maven 3.8+** (for backend development)
- **Node.js 20+** (for frontend development)
- **npm 10+** (for frontend development)

## Getting Started

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e_commerce
   ```

2. **Start all backend services**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Start the frontend** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Verify services are running**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Eureka Dashboard: http://localhost:8761
   - Gateway Swagger UI: http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html

5. **Stop all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Local Development

1. **Start infrastructure services**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker-compose up mysql kafka -d
   ```

2. **Run each backend service individually**
   ```bash
   cd <service-name>
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   Start services in this order:
   1. eureka-service-api
   2. gateway-service-api
   3. auth-service-api
   4. Other services (any order)

3. **Run the frontend**

- **Axios** for HTTP requests with interceptors

### Frontend Features

- 🔐 **Authentication**: Login and registration with JWT token management
- 🛍️ **Product Catalog**: Browse products with a beautiful grid layout
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items with real-time updates
- 📦 **Order Management**: View order history and details
